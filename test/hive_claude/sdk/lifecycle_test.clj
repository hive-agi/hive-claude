  "Comprehensive unit tests for sdk.lifecycle — spawn, dispatch, kill, interrupt, status.

   Strategy:
   - Session registry (atom) operations run against real implementation
   - Python bridge deps (event-loop, execution, options, availability) are mocked with with-redefs
   - Channel-based tests use drain-channel helper with timeout
   - Fixture cleans registry between tests"
