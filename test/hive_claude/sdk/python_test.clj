  "Unit tests for python.clj bridge layer.

   Strategy: Mock `requiring-resolve` to verify correct namespace/var
   resolution for each bridge function. Tests verify:
   - Correct libpython-clj2 namespace resolution
   - Argument passing and return value delegation
   - Graceful degradation when libpython-clj2 is absent
   - Error handling behavior (throw vs return nil)"
